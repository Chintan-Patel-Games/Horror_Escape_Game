# Horror Escape Game 👻🔦

**Horror Escape Game** is a small 3D horror-themed game built using **Unity** (C#). The project focuses on implementing the **Observer Pattern** using events and delegates, showcasing best practices in game communication and event-driven design.

# 🖥️ 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Unity (C#)**
- **Unity Events & Delegates**
- **3D Environment Setup**
- **Event-driven architecture**

# 🎮 Features

- Immersive horror environment
- Trigger-based events (e.g., lights off, sounds, door interactions)
- Escape-based objective
- Clean architecture for scalable event systems

# 🚀 How to Run

## Prerequisites

- Unity 2021.3 or later
- Git (optional, for cloning)

## Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chintan-Patel-Games/Horror_Escape_Game.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Unity:
3. Launch Unity Hub
4. Click "Open" and select the cloned folder
5. Open the main scene and click Play

# 📚 Concepts Demonstrated

- **Observer Pattern** – Components subscribe to and respond to events for decoupled communication
- **Delegates** – Define method signatures for flexible and reusable callback systems
- **Events** – Encapsulate delegate invocation and enable safe broadcasting of messages
- **Event System** – Centralized handling of custom game events for modular communication
- **Event Broadcasting** – Triggers and listeners handle in-game interactions and state changes
